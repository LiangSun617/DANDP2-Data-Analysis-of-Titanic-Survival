    "This project investigates a data set on the information of 891 passengers on a British liner named \"Titanic\" which sank in Atlantic Ocean on her maiden voyage from England to New York in 1912. There were 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, so the data set used here is an incomplete record of Titanic passengers.The data set  contains a variety of variables concerning passenger's age,gender, family, ticket, and survival infromation. The variables are listed as below:"

    "### 2. Statement of questions\n",
    "\n",
    "According to historical records, passengers were evacuated in lifeboats after Titanic started to sink. The only twenty lifeboats on the liner were supposed to accomodate 1,178 people but saved only about 600 lives. Anyway, not all passengers could have the chance to get in the lifeboats. It was reported that women and children were given priority to evacuate first. In addition, people in higher-class cabins had better access to the deck where lifeboats were equipped than people who stayed in third-class cabins which were on the lowest level in the ship. To sum up, the chance of survival may have been affected by a variety of factors, including gender, age, class and so on. Therefore, one of the questions to be answered by exploring this data set is what the relationship between these factors and one's chance of survival is. How did factors interact and co-determine the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "What made it more tragical is that many passengers went on the trip with their family. As passengers were not evacuated in family unit, many of them would have had to choose between surviving or dying with family, which was a toughest and heartbreaking situation that no one could imagine. Survivors who went on the trip with their family may have been separated forever. For those who finally survived, how many of them have lost their family members?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Given these thoughts, I will investigate the data set and answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How do the summary statistics of passengers, including their age, gender, and class of ticket,vary by survival?\n",
    "- What is the relationship between passenger's age and their chance of survival?\n",
    "- What is the relationship between passenger's gender and their chance of survival?\n",
    "- What is the relationship between passenger's ticket fare and their chance of survival?\n",
    "- What is the relationship between passenger's class of cabin and their chance of survival?\n",
    "- What is the relationship between port of embarkation and chance of survival?\n",
    "- How did different factors interact in determining the chance of survival?\n",
    "- How many survivors lost family members? \n"

    "Second, I explored the descriptive statistics of variables, mainly mean and standard deviation of each variable. I also checked how the descriptive statistics vary between survivors and non-survivors. The variables that showed evident difference between two groups are likely to have had an impact on chance of survival.\n",

I also acquired solutions to tenical problems I came across in the coding process from websites of data and programming."

    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The chance of survival from the Titanic disaster was determined by a variety of factors, mainly including gender, age, and class of cabin. These factors reveal two sides of the story, humanity and disparity. Because of humanity, women and children had better chance of survival than men, regardless of their background. Meanwhile, due to different socioeconomic status, more than half of the passengers in our data could only afford third-class cabins, which lethally reduced their chance of survival. However, humanity shines more because it shows how people made selfless decisions in the face of disaster. It is really heart-touching that many gentlemen gave away their chance of get in lifeboats and insisted on \"ladies and children first.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "It is hard to say which factor plays a more critical role from the data analysis here, but we can be sure that chance of survival is the result of a combination of various factors, and we can have better understanding of the pattern if more detailed information is available. "
